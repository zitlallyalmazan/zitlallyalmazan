### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

# I'm Zitlally, a software engineer from Salt Lake City, UT.

# I'm primarily interested in ###game development### and currently working as a front-end developer @Mobiledash. 

# I'm fascinated by large-scale, innovated games, but will always have a soft spot for a visually simple 2D RPG horror game. I focus on builidng games as fun personal projects in hopes to create a game loved by a few people. 

# Outside of work, I'm interested in the developments of science. I also play a lot of video games and enjoy a good horror or historical fiction book. 

# Let's connect!
